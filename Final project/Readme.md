Final Project : Temperature Prediction for Steelproof Steel Mill

Project Overview:
For my final Tripleten project, I led an effort to reduce production costs at Steelproof, a large steel mill. It was the culmination of my studies and applied the skills I had learnt in Tripleten. The aim was to reduce energy consumption during steel processing, focusing on a predictive model with an MAE target below 6.0.

Data exploration and cleaning:
Starting with data exploration, we fixed column names and addressed missing values in key datasets such as data_bulk and data_temp. Rigorous outlier cleaning ensured robust analyses.

Feature engineering and dataset preparation:
Dataset enrichment involved merging key datasets and streamlining features by removing unnecessary ones, thereby improving model efficiency.

Model training and evaluation:
The core of the project was to build a tuned linear regression model. It consistently predicted temperatures with a remarkable MAE of 3.9 degrees on the test dataset.

Insights and Impact:
This Tripleten project uncovered energy saving opportunities by intelligently reducing key iteration processes. Although not explicitly detailed, it sets the stage for significant cost reductions in steel production.

Embarking on this project as my final Tripleten endeavour was fulfilling, using data-driven insights to improve the efficiency and sustainability of Steelproof.
